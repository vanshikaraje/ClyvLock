# 🔐 ClyvrLock – Full-Stack Password Manager

[ClyvrLock](https://github.com/vanshikaraje/ClyvLock) is a modern, secure, and responsive password manager built with the **MERN stack** – React (with **Vite**), Express.js, and (coming soon) MongoDB – styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to store, view, update, and delete passwords with ease. Currently, it uses browser `localStorage` for temporary storage, with future plans to integrate MongoDB for persistent cloud-based storage.

> 📌 **Note:** Backend is ready. **MongoDB integration will be connected soon** to enable full-stack functionality.
